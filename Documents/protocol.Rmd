# Rationale and background

Phenotype error is acknowledged but rarely corrected for in causal effect estimation studies using observational data. Quantitative bias analysis (QBA) is a method for phenotype error correction, but the extent to which it minimizes bias in effect estimates is unclear.

# Study objectives

* Empirically evaluate QBA for outcome phenotype error correction in several pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effect estimation scenarios
* Simulate an analytic space defined by outcome incidence proportions (IP), observed effect estimates, and phenotype measurement errors to determine which QBA input combinations produce valid results.

# Research methods

## Quantitative bias analysis

QBA is a method for correcting outcome phenotype error that can bias comparative effect estimates[@Lash2009-ch; @Lash2014-jd]. Phenotype definition performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value) are required inputs for applying QBA. We use QBA for outcome phenotype error correction per the equations in **Table 1a** and **Table 1b**.

## Probabilistic reference standard validation

PheValuator is a method to calculate the performance characteristics of phenotype algorithms, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value[@Swerdel2019-fl; @Swerdel2022-pi]. It develops a diagnostic predictive model to determine a probabilistic reference standard of patients against which phenotype algorithm performance can be assessed. **Table 2** reports the PheValuator confusion matrix and error metric calculations.

The following cohorts are required input for a PheValuator validation study:

- Ischemic stroke events during inpatient or emergency room visits
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4008
- Extremely specific cohort (xSpec)
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4034
- Extremely sensitive cohort (xSens)
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4036
- Prevalence cohort
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4037
- Database population evaluation cohort
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4038
- Exposure population evaluation cohorts
  + https://epi.jnj.com/atlas/#/cohortdefinition/4521 (Note, this is a cohort shell with placeholders where drug exposure and condition occurrence concept sets. These replacements are made to construct the following exposure population evaluation cohorts: 
    - ACE exposed without ischemic stroke OR ACE exposed with subsequent ischemic stroke
    - ARB exposed without ischemic stroke OR ARB exposed with subsequent ischemic stroke
    - THZ exposed without ischemic stroke OR THZ exposed with subsequent ischemic stroke
    
Detailed cohort definitions for probabilistic reference standard validation are available in
[Appendix Section A][Probabilistic reference standard validation cohort definitions].

## Empirical example

### Design

Active comparator, new user comparative cohort study to estimate the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with hypertension initiating:

* Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) vs angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)
* Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) vs Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics (THZ)

### Exposure cohort definitions

Detailed exposure cohort definitions for 3 class-level hypertension treatments are in [Appendix Section B][Exposure cohort definitions]. 

#### ACEI new users with prior hypertension

- First use of ACEI on or after January 1, 2010 with â‰¥365 days of prior continuous database observation
  + â‰¥1 condition occurrence of hypertension between 365 and 0 days relative to first use
  + exactly 1 exposure to hypertension medications between 0 and 7 days relative to first use 
  + no prior exposure to hypertension medications

#### ARB new users with prior hypertension

- First use of ARB on or after January 1, 2010 with â‰¥365 days of prior continuous database observation
  + â‰¥1 condition occurrence of hypertension between 365 and 0 days relative to first use
  + exactly 1 exposure to hypertension medications between 0 and 7 days relative to first use 
  + no prior exposure to hypertension medications

#### THZ new users with prior hypertension

- First use of THZ on or after January 1, 2010 with â‰¥365 days of prior continuous database observation
  + â‰¥1 condition occurrence of hypertension between 365 and 0 days relative to first use
  + exactly 1 exposure to hypertension medications between 0 and 7 days relative to first use 
  + no prior exposure to hypertension medications

### Outcome definition

- Inpatient or emergency room visits on or after January 1, 2010
  + â‰¥1 condition occurrence of ischemic stroke
  + exactly 0 condition occurrences of ischemic stroke between -365 and -1 days relative to inpatient or emergency room visit with ischemic stroke

The detailed outcome definition for inpatient ischemic stroke is in [Appendix Section C][Outcome cohort definition].

### Data sources

The study will be executed against 4 US adminstrative healthcare claims and 1 US electronic health record databases.

- OptumÂ® de-identified ClinformaticsÂ® Datamart - Date of Death (optum_extended_dod)
- OptumÂ® Electronic Health Record (optum_ehr)
- IBM MarketScanÂ® Commercial Database (truven_ccae)
- IBM MarketScanÂ® Multi-State Medicaid (truven_mdcd)
- IBM MarketScanÂ® Medicare Supplemental Beneficiaries (truven_mdcr)

The database descriptions are in [Appendix Section D][Data sources].

### Outcome definition

See [Appendix Section B][Outcome definition] for detailed exposure definitions.

### Time-at-risk

- 1 day to 365 days relative to exposure start
- 1 day to 730 days relative to exposure start

### Analyses

- Calculate database-level (i.e., non-differential) and exposure-level (i.e., differential) ischemic stroke phenotype definition sensitivity and specificity using probabilistic reference standard validation studies in each data source
- Estimate comparative treatment effect using logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for ACE vs ARB and ACE vs THZ under the following analysis specifications:
  + Unadjusted
  + Non-differential QBA adjustment
  + Differential QBA adjustment
  + 1:1 propensity score (PS) matched
  + 1:1 PS matched with non-differential QBA
  + 1:1 PS matched with differential QBA
- Execute 5 databases x 2 comparisons x 2 TARs x 6 analyses] = 120 analyses

### Evaluation metrics

QBA performance evaluated by bias difference, relative bias, squared error, and precision difference between analyses that did vs did not include QBA.

- **Bias difference:** log(OR) - log(OR~QBA~)
- **Relative bias:** (OR - OR~QBA~) / OR * 100
- **Squared error:** (log(OR) - log(OR~QBA~)^2^
- **Precision difference:** 1 / (SE(log(OR))^2^ â€“ 1 / (SE(log(OR~QBA~))^2^

## Grid space simulation

### Inputs

Create grid space of all combinations of 4 input parameters:

- 5 outcome incidence proportions (IP) [10^-1^ , 10^-2^ , 10^-3^ , 10^-4^ , 10^-5^]
- 6 uncorrected odds ratios (OR) [1, 1.25, 1.50, 2, 4, 10]
- 20 non-differential sensitivity values [0.05 to 1.00 by 0.05]
- 20 non-differential specificity values [1 - prevalence to 1.00 by 5%^ile^]

The complete grid space consists of 12,000 2x2 contingency tables, each with 1,000,000 target and 1,000,000 comparator exposures and associated inputs.

### Analysis

For each IP-OR combination, compute a distribution of QBA-corrected ORs with 95% CIs across combinations of sensitivity and specificity values and plot contours across the complete IP by OR grid space.

### Evaluation metrics

The grid space simulation analysis will be evaluated by bias difference and relative bias between the unadjusted OR and the 25%^ile^, 50%^ile^, 75%^ile^, and maximum of the QBA-corrected distribution of estimates. Report the overall, IP-stratified, OR-stratified, and IP-OR-stratified proportion of the total grid space that produces valid (i.e., non-zero) QBA-corrected counts.

- **Bias difference:** log(OR) - log(OR~QBA~)
- **Relative bias:** (OR - OR~QBA~) / OR * 100

# Strengths and limitations

## Strengths

- 1
- 2
- 3

## Limitations

- Empirical example uses simple and multidimensional QBA only, no probabilistic QBA or multiple bias modeling
- Only uses sensitivity and specificity approach, no use of PPV and NPV
- Logistic regression outcome model assumes constant risk, discards survival information
- Assumes probabilistic reference validation metrics are accurate
- Validation study within exposure-indication populations will have incomplete overlap with restricted study populations

# Protection of human subjects
This work does not involve human patient research. It uses de-identified patient-level data collected during routine healthcare provision. Confidentiality of patient records will be maintained. Study reports will contain aggregate data only and will not identify individual patients of care providers.

Data source;Short name;Description
Optum(c) de-identified Electronic Health Record Dataset;optum_ehr;Optum(c) de-identified Electronic Health Record Dataset is derived from dozens of healthcare provider organizations in the United States (that include more than 700 hospitals and 7,000 Clinics treating more than 103 million patients) receiving care in the United States. The medical record data includes clinical information, inclusive of prescriptions as prescribed and administered, lab results, vital signs, body measurements, diagnoses, procedures, and information derived from clinical Notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Optum(c) de-Identified ClinformaticsÂ® Data Mart Database â€“ Date of Death;optum_dod;Optum(c) De-Identified Clinformatics(c) Data Mart Database is an adjudicated administrative health claims database for members with private health insurance, who are fully insured in commercial plans or Medicare Advantage. The population is primarily representative of US commercial claims patients (0-65 years old) with some Medicare (65+ years old) however ages are capped at 90 years. It includes data captured from administrative claims processed from inpatient and outpatient medical services and prescriptions as dispensed, as well as results for outpatient lab tests processed by large national lab vendors who participate in data exchange with Optum. Optum DOD also provides date of death (month and year only) for members with both medical and pharmacy coverage from the Social Security Death Master File (however after 2011 reporting frequency changed due to changes in reporting requirements) and location information for patients is at the US state level.
IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database;truven_ccae;IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (CCAE) is a US employer-based private-payer administrative claims database. The data include adjudicated health insurance claims (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy) as well as enrollment data from large employers and health plans who provide private healthcare coverage to employees, their spouses, and dependents.

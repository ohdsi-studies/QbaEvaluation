Empirical and simulated evaluation of quantitative bias analysis for outcome phenotype error correction in comparative effect estimation
========================================================================================================================================

This study empirically evaluates QBA for outcome phenotype error correction in several pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effect estimation scenarios. It also simulates an analytic space defined by outcome incidence proportions, observed effect estimates, and phenotype measurement errors to determine which QBA input combinations produce valid results.
